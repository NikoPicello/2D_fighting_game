# 2D_fighting_game
Each folder contains the scripts useful to handle the different scenes of the game and the player itself as well. 
Some parts are missing, and some are also wrongly programmed (I'll explain better in the report). 
Level is needed to handle the level initialization (the texts, the sliders, and all that). 
Main menu is used to handle the character selection screen. 
Player contains all the scripts used to program the behavior of the characters in the screen. 
Utilities contains all those scripts that are useful to handle minor scenarios.
The 2 scripts that are not in a folder are used to handle the transitions between animations.
